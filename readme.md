# ada's nvim config

hi i'm ada and these are my dotfiles :)

## setup

this config requires neovim 0.8+. this means on debian based repos you'll need to download and install it manually or find an alternative repository.

before you can use this setup you'll need to install [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)

i'm using [neovide](https://neovide.dev) but feel free to just use your terminal

## usage

this is a pretty simple config. it has the basics. 

| key | action |
| --- | ------ |
| [space] | leader key. opens which-key |
| ^b | open nvim-tree |
| ^\ | open terminal |
| ^j | previous tab |
| ^k | next tab |

the leader key is the spacebar. if you press it which-key will tell you what you can do.

use Mason to install LSPs/DAPs/linters/formatters
